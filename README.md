# Login and Sign-Up Form

## Brief Description of Approach
This project involves creating a responsive login and sign-up form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form is designed to be visually appealing, user-friendly, and mobile-responsive. It includes essential features such as input fields, a password toggle button (eye icon) to show/hide the password, error message handling, and buttons for login or sign-up actions.

### Features:
1. **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for different screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.
2. **Password Visibility Toggle**: Users can click an eye icon to toggle the visibility of their password.
3. **Error Handling**: Form inputs show error messages if invalid input is provided (e.g., empty fields or incorrect password format).
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: The form is simple to use, with clear labels and an easy-to-read layout.

## Additional Features or Enhancements Implemented
- **Responsive Design**: Media queries were added for various screen sizes (mobile and tablet) to ensure the form adapts to different devices.
- **Visual Enhancements**: Improved input styling, button hover effects, and shadow effects for a polished design.
- **User Experience**: The eye icon toggles between showing and hiding the password, improving usability.
